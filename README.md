# Analysing Medical Insurance Data - Python Project

### The goal of this project is to analyse a particular population and factors affecting medical insurance costs. The analysis focuses on comparing summary statistics of different groups of the population (e.g. smokers and non-smokers).
### The pre-cleaned data was made available by Codecademy.
### This was my first project, which I used to practice Python fundamentals.
