# Analysing Medical Insurance Data - Python Project

### The goal of this project is to analyse a particular population and factors affecting medical insurance costs. The analysis focuses on comparing summary statistics of different groups of the population (e.g. smokers and non-smokers).
### The pre-cleaned data was made available by Codecademy, but it is me who defined the objectives and all steps of the analysis.
